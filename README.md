### Files in the Repository:
The files uploaded mainly relate to the mapping of the bike share ridership data, allowing the team to analyze where bike users start and end their journey with Latitude and Longitude. First, the data of bike share ridership is merged into one large csv file, then analyzed based on count, year and location.This allows us to identify areas where bike users are getting on and off frequently, and correlate this with the traffic collisions open dataset.

### Why Cyclist Data?
ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“ˆ  The number of cyclists have sharply increased from 2019 to 2023, from 2 million to 6 million rides per year on the Bike Share platform alone.
